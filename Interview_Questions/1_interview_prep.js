// 1) What skills does a front-end developer need?
//    :- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
//    :-  Version control
//    :-  Frameworks
//    :-  Testing and debugging
//    :-  Responsive web design

// 2) Define HTML meta tags
//    :- The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document
//    :- Always found within the <head> section of an HTML document.
//    :- Defined using the <meta> tag, which is a self-closing tag (e.g., 
//       <meta charset="UTF-8">)

// 3) Differentiate between div and span?
//    :- 'Div' = * Block-level
//               * Takes up the full width available, with a new line before and after
//               * Used to group larger blocks of content or other elements
//               * Significant, as it often creates a "box" for other elements
//               * It can contain other block-level elements or inline elements
//   
//    :- 'Span' = * Inline
//                * Only takes up as much width as necessary, without forcing new lines
//                * Used to group a small chunk of HTML elements or to apply styling
//                  to part of a text.
//                * Minimal, typically used for styling text or small elements within text
//                * Typically contains only data or other inline elements
//
// 4) What is React JS?
//     :- React is a JavaScript library.
//        React is a User Interface (UI) library.
//        React is a tool for building UI components.
//
// 5) Describe the advantages of REST web services?
//     :- Scalability
//        Flexibility and Portability
//        Simplicity and Ease of Use
//        Interoperability
//        REST APIs can handle various data formats (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML).
//
// 6) How browsers render the UI?
//     :- DOM Construction:
//                  The browser receives HTML bytes, converts them into characters, then tokens, and finally creates nodes 
//                  that form the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
//     :- CSSOM Construction:
//                  Concurrently, the browser parses CSS (from external files, <style> tags, or inline styles)
//                  and constructs the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) tree.
//     :- Render Tree Construction:
//                   This tree only includes visible elements and their computed styles,
//                   excluding non-visual elements like <head> or display: none elements
//     :- Layout (Reflow):
//                    This involves determining dimensions, margins, padding, and positioning 
//                    based on the CSS Box Model and layout rules.
//   
// 7) What is a Grid system in CSS?
//     :- Grid Container:
//                     This is the parent element to which display: grid; or display: inline-grid; is applied. All direct children of
//                     the grid container automatically become grid items.
//     :- Grid Items:
//                 These are the direct children of the grid container that are arranged within the grid.
//     :- Grid Lines:
//                 These are the horizontal and vertical lines that define the structure of the grid, separating columns and rows. 
//     :- Grid Tracks:
//                 These are the spaces between two adjacent grid lines, representing the rows and columns.
//
// 8) Describe the distinction between Class and Prototypal inheritance in Javascript?
//     :- Prototypal Inheritance: 
//                 A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly
//                 from other objects.
//     :- Class Inheritene :
//                 In JavaScript, class inheritance is implemented on top of prototypal inheritance,
//                 but that does not mean that it does the same thing
//
// 9) Explain user-centered design?
//     :- User-Centered Design (UCD) is a design approach and iterative process that places the needs, behaviors, and
//        preferences of the end-users at the forefront of product and service development
//
// 10) What is ClickJacking?
//     :- Clickjacking is a type of attack in which the victim clicks on links on a website the victim believes to be a known, trusted website. However, they are 
//         actually clicking on a hidden website that has been overlaid onto the known website.
//
// 11) Tell me when and why should I make use of Webpack?
//     :- It's a tool that lets you bundle your JavaScript applications (supporting both ESM and CommonJS), and it can be extended
//        to support many different assets such as images, fonts and stylesheets.
// 
// 12) Mention three ways to decrease page load time?
//     :- Three methods to decrease page load time include:
//           (a) Optimize Images:
//                       Large image files are a common cause of slow page load times. Optimizing images involves compressing them to reduce file size without significantly compromising visual quality, using appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP for better compression
//                        where supported, JPEG for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency) 
//           (b) Minify and Combine Files:
//                       Minification involves removing unnecessary characters (like whitespace, comments, and line breaks) from HTML, CSS, and 
//                       JavaScript files without altering their functionality. 
//           (c) Enable Browser Caching:
//                       Caching allows a user's browser to store static resources (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files) locally after the first visit. When the user revisits the site, the browser can load these cached resources directly from their local storage instead of requesting them from t
//                       he server again, leading to much faster subsequent page loads
//  
//
//
